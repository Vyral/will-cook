Are you looking to sell a home? At times, it may seem like you are adrift on an endless sea of paperwork. So many documents are required during the sale of a home that it can be confusing and worrisome. It’s easy to become overwhelmed, which is why I’ve put together this brief primer to help you navigate the process. This isn’t an exhaustive list of all the documents you might need during a sale, but it should help you get the ball rolling.

**1\. Pre-listing paperwork.** This is possibly the most paperwork-intensive portion of the process. Put simply, this is when you need to gather all of the documentation for your ownership of the property and any changes you’ve made. This might include things like the title or deed, receipts and other documents for recent improvements, warranties and other information regarding your appliances, and any records relating to an HOA or other agreements. The disclosures and documentation required by a seller can vary widely depending on your specific situation and location, so be sure to connect with a trusted, local real estate agent like me to help you with gathering these documents.

**2\. Listing paperwork.** This one is a lot easier for the homeowner. This will include things like a title check, disclosure paperwork, and a listing agreement. Much of this paperwork should have been gathered before listing, and some of it will be the responsibility of your real estate agent. Be sure to work closely with your agent to make sure that you have all of the necessary documents.

**3\. The offer and closing paperwork.** This is another step in the process that is heavy on documentation. Much of it will be included in the prior steps, but you’ll also need new things like the purchase offer, appraisals, and inspections. You’ll already have some of this paperwork, you’ll receive some of it during the selling process, and other parts will be generated by your real estate agent and the mortgage companies. The most important things you’ll want to have on hand during this process are your identification and the deed to the home.

As I said before, this is not a complete list of the paperwork you’ll need. Plus, your specific city, county, and state might have different requirements.
