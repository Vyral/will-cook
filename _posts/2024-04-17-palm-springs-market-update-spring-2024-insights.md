The real estate market in Palm Springs is showing interesting trends that both buyers and sellers should be aware of. Here's a detailed look at the current state of the market and what you can expect in the coming months.

This spring has seen a noticeable increase in home sales compared to last year, with sales averaging 633 units this month compared to 577 units a year ago. Despite this increase, sales are still 21.7% below normal seasonal levels, although this represents a slight improvement from the previous month. **It's an encouraging sign, indicating a potential shift toward normalcy by year's end.**

The median price for a detached home in March stood firm at $700,000, marking a 2.2% increase from last year. This trend of rising spring prices is expected to continue over the next few months. However, with inventory levels rising and sales remaining low, the market is slowly starting to favor buyers, which could limit price gains. As of April 1st, the inventory in the Valley was at its highest since June 2020, with 2,450 units available, though still below the historical norm by 500 to 1000 units.

**The increase in inventory and the gradual market shift are starting to influence selling strategies.** Homes that are recently renovated or updated are becoming more attractive to buyers, who are showing a preference for move-in-ready properties and are willing to pay a premium for such homes. Sellers, therefore, need to consider the market dynamics and price their homes competitively to attract serious buyers.

For buyers, the landscape is also changing. Mortgage rates have risen slightly and remain high as the Federal Reserve continues its efforts to tame inflation. Potential rate cuts later in the year could increase competition in the market, making it crucial for buyers to stay informed and ready to act.

While we're technically still in a seller's market, the balance is beginning to tip slightly in favor of buyers. Whether you're looking to buy or sell, working with an experienced real estate agent is more crucial than ever to navigate these shifting sands.
