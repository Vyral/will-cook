Every seller wants to get as much money as possible for their home, but few know how to accomplish this. As it turns out, there are four steps you can take to prepare your home to sell for top dollar.

**1. Do the ordinary updates.** These updates include replacing rotten wood, taking care of a leaky roof, getting rid of mold, and remediating other water intrusion issues. It’s also a good idea to put a new coat of paint on the walls. Buyers tend to look over houses very carefully, so it’s important to check out every inch of your home and update what you can without breaking the bank.

**2. Consider remodeling or updating your kitchen.** If it looks dated, repaint the walls, install a new backsplash, and purchase new, energy-efficient appliances. If you’re going to repaint, consider using low VOC paint, as it has fewer harsh chemicals and is more eco-friendly.

**3. Improve your outdoor environment.** A great outdoor space can make or break a sale, especially here in the greater Palm Springs area, where we enjoy so many months of incredible weather. Update your landscaping by installing drought-tolerant flowering plants or perhaps an outdoor seating area. For larger projects, you might want to consider creating a covered outdoor entertainment space, or possibly some hardscaping with pavers and a firepit. If your pool needs cleaning or resurfacing, go ahead and do that. Additionally, be sure to take advantage of any views that your property has.

**4. Prioritize energy efficiency.** More buyers today than ever are looking for energy-efficient installments. To take advantage of this, consider replacing your windows, buying Energy Star appliances, or installing LED canned lighting. These features are not only appealing to prospective buyers, but they can also lower your energy bills while you’re still living in the home.
