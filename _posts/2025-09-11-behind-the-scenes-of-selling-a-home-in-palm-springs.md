From the outside, selling a home appears to be a simple process. One day it’s yours, the next day there’s a sign in the yard and your home’s online. But the real work happens in between. Here’s what happens behind the scenes to ensure your home sells effectively.

**The walkthrough.** We start with a walkthrough of your home. I come in with a fresh set of eyes, the way a buyer would. First impressions matter. I look for minor fixes that make a significant impact, like touching up paint, decluttering spaces, or adding light to brighten rooms. Even little changes can make your home feel larger, warmer, and more welcoming.

**The prep plan**. After the walkthrough, I create a clear plan to prepare your home. This includes scheduling trusted vendors such as painters, stagers, landscapers, or handymen so you don’t have to chase quotes or worry about logistics. Having a plan keeps the process organized and ensures nothing’s overlooked.

**Preparing the seller.** Selling isn’t just about the house. It’s also about you. Letting go of a home you’ve lived in for years can be emotional. I help prepare you for the ups and downs of the process, answer your questions, and make sure you feel confident about what’s ahead. When you know what to expect, the whole journey feels less stressful.

**Pricing with strategy.** Setting the right price is one of the most critical steps. This isn’t guesswork. I study homes that have recently sold, homes that are pending, and the active competition in your neighborhood. Together, we use that data to position your home in the market. The goal is to attract buyers while still protecting your equity.

**Marketing rollout.** Once your home’s prepped and priced, the launch begins. Professional photos showcase your home in the best light and grab buyers’ attention. From there, we roll out polished marketing copy, social media campaigns, email outreach, and a launch plan that’s timed for maximum impact. All of it’s designed to drive buyers to schedule showings quickly.

**Final briefing**. Before your home goes live, I sit down with you to cover the details. We review how showings will work, what kind of feedback to expect, and how to handle fast offers or slower weeks. This step makes sure you know exactly what’s happening every step of the way.

When your home goes live, it may look effortless, but the truth is every strong launch comes from weeks of planning and preparation. Selling a home doesn’t have to feel overwhelming when you’ve got the proper process in place.
