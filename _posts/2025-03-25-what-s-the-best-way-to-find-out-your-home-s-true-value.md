Ever wonder how much your home is actually worth? Whether you're thinking about selling, refinancing, or just curious, knowing your home’s true value is essential. But here’s the issue—many homeowners rely on the wrong sources and leave money on the table.

Most people turn to quick online estimates, but those tools can be off by tens of thousands of dollars. If your home is priced too high, buyers may overlook it. Price it too low, and you’re walking away from potential profit. And when refinancing, an inaccurate valuation could mean missing out on thousands in equity. So, how do you ensure you’re working with the right number? Having helped countless homeowners maximize their home’s value, I can tell you this: understanding your home’s worth isn’t just about numbers—it’s about making informed financial decisions. There are three key ways to determine your home’s true value:

**1\. Comparative market analysis.** This is a professional assessment done by a real estate expert—like me! A CMA compares your home to similar recently sold homes in your area, factoring in size, features, location, and market trends. It’s free and far more accurate than online tools.

**2\. Professional appraisal.** A licensed appraiser provides an unbiased valuation, often required for refinancing or loans. They assess your home’s condition, upgrades, and market comps. It’s the most precise method but comes at a cost of a few hundred dollars.

**3\. Online valuation tools and research.** Websites like Zillow and Redfin provide quick estimates, but you shouldn’t rely on them alone. Cross-check multiple sources and look at recently sold homes that closely match yours for a more accurate picture.

Which is the best option for you? If you’re selling, a CMA gives you an accurate market value. If you’re refinancing, an appraisal is necessary. And if you’re just curious, online tools can be a starting point—but always verify with expert insight. If you’re thinking of selling or refinancing and want a precise, expert-backed valuation, let’s talk. I offer a free, no-obligation home valuation to help you make the best decision.
