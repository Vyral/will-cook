<p style="text-align: center;"><em>We hope that you and yours have a safe and wonderful Thanksgiving holiday.</em></p>

The 2020 holiday season has officially begun, and we hope you are as excited about it as we are. Despite the challenges that 2020 has brought us, we want to take a moment to express our gratitude and appreciation for you, our clients, supporters, vendor partners, and associates. Without you, we wouldn't have been able to assist as many people realize their real estate dreams as we did this year. So thank you, and we wish you, your family, and your friends a very happy Thanksgiving\! In the meantime, if you have any real estate-related questions about the greater Palm Springs area, we are here to help, so please feel free to reach out.
