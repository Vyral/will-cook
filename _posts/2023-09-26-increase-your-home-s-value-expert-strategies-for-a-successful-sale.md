If you’re thinking about selling your home anytime soon, you need to know how to get the most money out of it. Too many people fall into the trap of thinking they don’t need to put in any work or that they need to spend enormous amounts of money to increase the value of their homes. The truth is that effort is necessary, but a little bit can go a long way. Here are my three tips for how to increase the value of your home:&nbsp;

**1\. Make a good first impression.** The truth is that the first look can make or break your sale. Potential buyers have already judged your house before they walk in the door—and in today’s market, they’ve even made judgments before that when they saw photos online! Therefore, put in the work to get high-quality, professional photos, as well as improve your curb appeal. This can be as easy as mowing the lawn and putting in fresh flowers.&nbsp;

**2\. Display the value of your space.** Start by decluttering your home. Potential buyers don’t want to see your photos and knick-nacks, but they do want to see that there’s plenty of room to store their things. Therefore, clearing out some of your closets, for example, can make a big difference. Also, consider professional staging and high-quality lighting. These things will showcase the great parts of your home.

**3\. Work with a trusted Realtor.** Who you work with matters. Unfortunately, too many people just work with the first agent they talk to, who says they can get a good price, and then end up suffering because of that. You need to work with an experienced professional with a top-notch marketing plan who is great at negotiations and can help you understand the current market to get the most money possible.&nbsp;

There are many things you can work on to get top dollar for your property, but those are the three most important ones. If you have any questions, want advice on what else you can do, or want to work with this experienced professional, don’t hesitate to reach out! You can call or email me anytime, and I would love to help you.
