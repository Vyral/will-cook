What keeps homes from selling in summer? Picture this: You listed your home expecting it to sell quickly, but it’s been weeks and you’re still waiting. No offers. Fewer showings. A growing sense of frustration. Many homeowners are realizing that the summer 2025 market isn’t what it was earlier this year. More homes are hitting the market and buyers have more options. And with interest rates still high, they’re being more selective. The good news is that there are clear reasons homes sit and practical ways to turn things around. Here are three things you can do to sell quickly and for the best price this summer:

**1\. Check your price.** Pricing is often the first issue. A number that made sense in the spring may not hold up today. With more competition, buyers are comparing every home they see. They’ll keep moving if your price feels too high for what you’re offering. This is where a fresh market analysis helps. Ask your agent to look at sales from the last 30 days, not last quarter. A small adjustment could attract renewed interest if your price is no longer competitive.

**2\. Fix the things that turn buyers off.** Today’s buyers are cautious. Many are using all their available funds to close, so they aren’t looking for homes that need repairs. Minor issues like scuffed walls, dripping faucets, or worn carpet can make a home feel neglected. You don’t need a complete remodel, but minor updates matter. Paint touch-ups, clean spaces, and simple repairs go a long way. Also, make it easy for people to see the home. If showing times are limited, your buyer pool shrinks. The more access you give, the more chances you have to get offers.

**3\. Update your marketing strategy.** A strong online presence is essential. Buyers may never take the next step if your listing has basic photos and no video. Ask your agent about professional photography, video walkthroughs, and social media promotion. These tools help your home stand out and reach people who are actively searching. Good marketing is no longer optional—it’s expected.

If your home has been sitting with little interest, now is the time to act. A few focused changes can make a real difference. I’d be happy to take a closer look and give you a custom plan to help your home get the attention it deserves. Reach out today and let’s make your home the next one to sell.
