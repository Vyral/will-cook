There are three key reasons that you should live in a home before renovating it.

I often recommend that homebuyers live in a house for awhile before they undertake large renovation or expansion projects. Now, I’m not talking about basic plumbing or electrical issues that are necessary to make a home habitable; I’m rather talking about larger renovations and expansions.

Why live in a new home before renovating? Well, **there are three good reasons to consider holding off on big home improvement projects until you’ve had time to settle in:**

**1\. Living in a home can change your mind.** You may have grand visions of what you’d like to do to a home based on its condition and your priorities, but until you’ve actually lived there for a time, it’s difficult to know exactly how you’re going to use the house, as well as what projects will and won’t work. Ultimately, it’s your day-to-day experience that will inform your home improvement decisions, not your early notions of how you want your everyday experience to be.

**2\. You deserve a break after buying a home.** Buying a home is a stressful project and an enormous change in your life. In addition to being a shock to your system, it may also be a shock to your finances. I’ve seen buyers jump through hoops for months on end, spending enormous amounts of time to look for homes. For some, it becomes a part-time job. With all the decisions to make and the contractors to deal with, a home renovation can become yet another big, stressful project. Take a break from that stress and enjoy your home for awhile.

**3\. You need time to plan.** Any renovation, no matter how small, should be designed with care; that means speaking to multiple architects, contractors, and designers to get their take on your ideas and options, which is a time-consuming process. Some buyers may want to jump right into renovations because they don’t want to live in a construction zone or pay rent and a mortgage at the same time. This may make some economic sense superficially, but it can cause some costly problems later on.

While you should be open to doing work on a home, don’t feel stressed about getting it done all at once. Live in your home as is for six months up to a year; take it for a “test drive” and see how it runs. You may be surprised at how your perspective and priorities change once you’ve had some time to settle in.
