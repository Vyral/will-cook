What does a buyer's agent really do? If you think buying a home is just about finding the perfect place online and signing a few papers, think again. There’s a lot more going on behind the scenes, and if you’re not prepared, it can get complicated fast. That's where I come in.

As your buyer's agent, I'm not just here to show homes. I'm here to guide, protect, and help you make smart moves from start to finish.

**Understanding the process.** From day one, I help you understand everything you need to know before you even set foot inside a home. That includes what neighborhoods are like, how much homes really cost, what fees come with owning, and what rules might apply, such as HOA rules or whether a home is in a flood zone.

I also help you figure out what you can afford so you’re not wasting time on homes that are outside your budget. And when you do find "the one," I’ll move quickly to get you in the door.

**Smart move and strategy.** Buying a home takes more than luck. It takes a smart plan. I help you compare homes, understand the value, and write offers that stand out. From setting timelines to choosing the right terms, we make sure everything protects you while also keeping you competitive. And when it comes to negotiating with the other agent? That’s my job too.

**Making sure nothing falls through the cracks.** Once your offer is accepted, I will help make sure everything stays on track. I coordinate inspections, keep in touch with lenders and title teams, and stay on top of every deadline. I’m always watching for possible issues before they become real problems.

When you work with me, you’re not doing this alone. Even after you get the keys, I stay in touch to connect you with helpful vendors and answer any questions. You’ve got a full-time advocate who knows the process, speaks the language, and is ready to help you every step of the way.
