In today's fall real estate market update, we'll dive into the latest trends in the Coachella Valley. Over the past few months, the region has witnessed a decline in home sales, with October numbers showing a decrease of 53 units compared to the previous year. The 12-month average reveals a 25% drop in sales year-over-year. This shift in the market landscape has implications for both buyers and sellers. Stay tuned as we explore the factors influencing these changes, from interest rates to inventory levels, and what they mean for those looking to buy or sell their homes in the Coachella Valley.
