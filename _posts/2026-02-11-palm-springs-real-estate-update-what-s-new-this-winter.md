If you’ve been watching headlines or listening to market chatter, it can be hard to tell whether the Palm Springs real estate market is cooling off or simply catching its breath. Winter has a way of amplifying uncertainty, but the data tells a much clearer and more grounded story.

The market has shifted out of the rapid pace of recent years and into a phase where decisions matter more than urgency, which makes understanding the numbers especially important right now.

**Pricing.** Home prices across the Coachella Valley have remained relatively stable as the market moves through the winter season. The median price for a detached home currently sits at $675,000, reflecting a modest 3% year-over-year decline that aligns with normal seasonal patterns. Prices have largely held onto the gains made during the pandemic, suggesting normalization rather than any meaningful loss in value.

When pricing is examined more closely at the city level, the picture becomes more nuanced. Areas such as Indian Wells continue to show year-over-year price growth, while Palm Desert and Palm Springs are seeing slightly softer conditions. Looking at price per square foot offers a clearer measure of true value by removing the noise created by individual sales.

**Inventory.** Inventory has returned to more familiar levels across the valley. There are currently 3,488 homes for sale, which is about 3% higher than last year and in line with pre-pandemic conditions. This shift has given buyers more options and has helped restore balance to negotiations, easing the pressure that defined much of the past few years.

With more homes on the market, pricing and positioning now play a larger role, since buyers are comparing choices rather than competing aggressively for limited supply.

**Days on market.** Homes are taking slightly longer to sell, with the median days on market now at 47 days. While this is marginally higher than last year, this range has remained steady for more than two years, which suggests the market is functioning normally rather than slowing down.

When days on market are viewed by price range, the gap between lower-priced and higher-priced homes is narrower than expected. This trend points to steady demand across price segments, including higher-priced homes, as long as pricing and presentation align with current conditions.

**What does this all mean?** The Greater Palm Springs real estate market is no longer driven by urgency, but it also isn’t showing signs of weakness. Buyers have more flexibility and negotiating power, while sellers need to focus on accurate pricing and thoughtful preparation to maintain leverage. Overall, the market is balanced, data-driven, and offering opportunities for those who approach decisions with clarity and realistic expectations.

Navigating today’s real estate market doesn’t have to feel complicated. With the right pricing approach, clear expectations, and a strategy grounded in current data, buyers and sellers can move forward with confidence.
