Here are the seven silly mistakes you need to avoid so that they don’t sabotage your home sale:

**1\. Cords hanging from a wall-mounted TV. **

**2\. An unkempt yard.** Curb appeal is a real thing. We often encourage our buyers to drive buy the home they want to look at, and an unkempt yard can send the wrong message to buyers about what they’ll find on the inside of the home.

**3\. A dingy front door.** When showing a home, it takes a Realtor about 30 seconds to retrieve the key from the lockbox and unlock the door. During this time, the buyer is taking in the scene, and a newly painted front door, welcome mat, or pot of flowers can send a strong welcoming message to them.

**4\. Not cleaning up after your pets.** We all love our pets, but some buyers have pet allergies, and it’s a real turnoff when buyers can smell your pet’s odors.

**5\. Poor furniture arrangement.** You want to show off your home to look as spacious and inviting as possible. This way, a buyer can imagine their own furniture in your space

**6\. Stuffed junk drawers, crammed cabinets, and overfilled closets.** We all have lots of stuff, but when a buyer views your home, you want to make sure there is plenty of room for their things. If closets, for example, are overpacked, it sends a message that there might not be room for their items.

**7\. Cluttered countertops.** Similar to closets, you want buyers to feel like they have a lot of space to cook and entertain in the kitchen. The kitchen is one of the most important rooms in the house, so you want it to make a great first impression.

It’s the little things that make the biggest difference during your home sale, which is why we give all of our sellers a thorough consultation that includes staging tips, resources to home stagers and house cleaners, and storage unit options. It’s our goal to get you more money for your home.
