I am coming at you from one of my new listings (a beautiful vacation rental with three bedrooms and two bathrooms) to ask, “How can you be successful with vacation rentals in the Palm Springs area?” Recently I received three tips from property managers helping explain how to be successful and I thought I would share them with you today.

First, however, I want to talk about measure C which was voted on banning vacation rentals. This measure was specifically for single-family homes in Palm Springs that are not in HOAs since the HOA rules take precedence over city ordinance. However, by a 2/3 majority vote, that vacation rental ban did not happen, leaving vacation rentals alive and well in our area.

**1. Think high-end hotel.** From your linens to your toiletries, whatever you offer guests should be similar to that of a five-star hotel. You should provide ample linens so your guests do not feel obligated to wash anything during their stay. Supply shampoo, toothpaste, mints, etc. to your guests for the bathroom as well as coffee, tea, soft drinks, and bottled water for the kitchen.

**2. Storage area**. Have your own basic storage space for your house supplies and personal belongings. You could have a locked closet in the master or use a spare hallway closet. This gives you space for supplies for not only the house, but for you if you ever plan on staying there.

**3. Welcome booklet.** Create a welcome booklet for guests that gives instructions on how to use anything technical in the home such as the televisions, audio equipment, or alarm system. This helps prevent them from having to call you personally or your property manager. You should also include any house rules or community ordinances. And, you can even add local attractions and restaurant recommendations for the area.

If you have any additional questions, are interested in buying the lovely home seen in the video, or are looking at selling your own home, please feel free to contact me. I would be happy to speak with you.
