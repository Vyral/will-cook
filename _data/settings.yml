  about_markdown: >-
    A seasoned professional with an unwavering commitment to excellence, Will
    Cook has firmly established himself as one of the top real estate agents in
    the Greater Palm Springs Area. Ranked in the top 1.5% of all agents
    nationally, in the top 1% valley-wide, and recognized as a Palm Springs Life
    Top Realtor for multiple years, including 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2024, and
    2025, Will is a trusted name in luxury real estate.


    An associate broker with Equity Union Real Estate, Will brings over 23 years
    of experience and an impressive track record of multi-million-dollar sales.
    His expertise extends beyond Palm Springs, having successfully marketed and
    sold high-end homes in the luxury markets of Boston and Miami Beach. Whether
    working with affluent buyers and sellers of exclusive estates or guiding
    first-time homeowners and investors, Will’s approach remains the
    same—delivering exceptional results with integrity, accountability, and a
    client-first mindset.


    A native of Baton Rouge, LA, Will pursued graduate studies in Boston before
    entering the medical software industry, where he specialized in managing
    large-scale implementation projects. His corporate background honed his
    ability to strategize, negotiate, and communicate effectively—skills that
    seamlessly translated into his real estate career. Known for his market
    expertise, strong negotiation skills, and ability to simplify complex
    transactions, Will has built a reputation as a trusted advisor. His clients
    often commend him for his hands-on approach, deep market knowledge, and
    ability to turn real estate goals into reality. At the core of Will’s
    success is his passion for helping his clients. He loves what he does—and we
    think that makes a difference.
