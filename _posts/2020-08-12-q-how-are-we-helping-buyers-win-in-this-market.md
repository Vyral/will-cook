Here’s how we’re helping frustrated buyers win in this market.</em></p>

We’re in a very competitive seller’s market in the Coachella Valley and the Greater Palm Springs Area. As a result, a lot of our buyers are very frustrated with being able to find a right home or getting their offer accepted when they do.

We’re finding ourselves in a lot more multiple-offer situations these days and our buyers want to know, “How can I make my offer stand out?”

**One strategy we’re having success with is abbreviating some contingency periods**, specifically the loan, due diligence, and appraisal contingency periods. In fact, some of our buyers have removed one or more of these contingencies upfront and allowed for the due diligence period to complete those items.&nbsp;

In California, the due diligence period is typically 17 days and allows buyers to back out for any reason during that time. **We’re suggesting that our buyers remove the appraisal and loan contingencies,** making sure their lender can get an appraisal done quickly during that due diligence period.

If you have any other questions for me about buying a home, we’re happy to talk and strategize about how to get your offer accepted. We’ve had a lot of success over the last few months and are here to answer your questions at any time. We look forward to hearing from you.
