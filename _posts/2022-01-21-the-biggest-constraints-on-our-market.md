What’s the biggest constraint in our current real estate market? Calculated Risk founder Bill McBride recently said, “*It is possible that the rising mortgage rates will slow the housing market, … or the Fed might raise rates sooner than expected due to the recent pickup in inflation, … but I believe one thing is certain: Inventory will tell the tale\!*” There’s quite a bit of speculation in the market right now. So today I’m discussing the constraints and numbers that tell us what’s going on in our market.
