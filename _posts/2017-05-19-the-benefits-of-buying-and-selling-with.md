Why work with just one agent when buying and selling a home? You can turn both transactions into one smooth process. Here's how.

When you're looking to buy a home, working with just one agent will be very beneficial to you.

You want a single, trusted advisor who truly understands what you're looking for in a home. **You'll come across many agents early in your search, and it's important to pick the one you connect with best. You should feel that they will represent you and your interests best.**

Aligning yourself with a single agent creates continuity in your search and prevents you wasting time being shown the same home multiple times. Agents don't get paid unless they find you the home of your dreams and close on it, which can be a long process. Your Realtor will work hard to understand your needs and find you the right home, as well as working in your interest to negotiate a contract and shepherd you through the closing process.

In return, all they ask is for your loyalty when you are searching for a home.

This just means calling your agent FIRST if you have questions about a property you see online, at an open house, or just driving around. All agents have access to the multiple listing service as a way to get exposure for our listings, and our MLS facilitates a cooperating agreement between all member agents and brokers. Unless you're talking about a pocket listing (not yet live on the market), we all have the same information.

**The one agent you align yourself with should have knowledge in the areas you're interested in and who you feel will work in your interest to find your dream home.**

If you have any other questions about real estate or you're thinking about buying or selling a home here in the Palm Springs area, you can always give me a call or send me an email. I'd be happy to help!
