Homeowners in California have been facing challenges in securing insurance coverage, with major companies like Allstate and State Farm making headlines by either withdrawing from the state entirely or ceasing to offer homeowner's insurance policies. The root of this issue lies in the broader struggle that insurance companies face nationwide due to inflation.

The escalating costs of materials and labor, exacerbated by inflation, have put a financial strain on insurers. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced in states prone to natural disasters, such as California, Florida, and Texas. The consequence? Insurance companies still operating in California are becoming increasingly selective with their clientele, aiming to minimize risk.

**One noticeable trend is the tightening of eligibility criteria.** Once satisfied with no claims in the last three years, insurers now demand a clean record for the last five years. To encourage risk reduction, companies also promote the bundling of auto and home insurance policies, often resulting in more competitive pricing. For prospective homeowners, securing insurance promptly is crucial, particularly once escrow is initiated.

For existing policyholders, allowing coverage to lapse is a risky move. If your insurer has issued a notice of non-renewal, failing to secure a new policy before the expiration could lead to difficulties and increased costs in obtaining fresh coverage.

Consider this pro tip: **explore the option of a higher deductible on your homeowner's insurance.** A higher deductible can help you avoid filing numerous small claims, potentially leading to elevated premiums or, in extreme cases, a denial of coverage. Consulting with an insurance professional about adjusting your deductible and strategically managing claims for catastrophic events could result in substantial savings on premiums.

When navigating the complex landscape of homeowners insurance in California, partnering with a knowledgeable broker is invaluable. Brokers with access to multiple carriers can offer a range of options tailored to your specific needs.
