<p style="text-align:center"><em>Once you’ve decided to sell your home, make sure to take these four steps before it goes live on the market.</em></p>

Before you decide your home is ready to be seen by potential buyers, it’s important to take four key steps before putting it up for sale on the market to ensure it sells for its maximum value:

**1\. Re-paint.** Giving your walls a fresh coat of paint will not only make your home appear cleaner and brighter, but it will also help to conceal any cracks or damage.&nbsp;

**2\. Make necessary repairs.** Buyers are going to be going through every detail of your home with a fine-toothed comb. So, before they have the chance to do so, make sure you fix any and all problems they might uncover. This includes structural, mechanical, and safety issues alike.

**3\. Fix up your landscaping.** Your home’s curb appeal will serve as your potential buyers’ first impression, and having great landscaping will help ensure it’s a good one. Adding fresh mulch, planting some flowers, and trimming up bushes and trees can go a long way.

**4\. Deep clean.** This is probably one of the most important steps. You may even want to hire a professional cleaning crew to make sure every nook and cranny is sparkling. After all, having a clean home is crucial to impressing buyers.&nbsp;
