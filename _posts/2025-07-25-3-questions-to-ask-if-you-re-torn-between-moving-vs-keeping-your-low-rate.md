Many homeowners today feel stuck. If you locked in a rock-bottom interest rate in 2020 or 2021, the thought of losing it might make moving seem unthinkable even if your current home no longer works for you.

If this sounds familiar, you’re not alone. I talk to people every day who are wrestling with the same dilemma: “Do I prioritize my low payment, or do I find a home that actually fits my life?” Before you decide, ask yourself these three questions:

**1\. Is your home still working for your life?** A low rate only goes so far if the house no longer supports your lifestyle. The space may feel tighter, or your daily routine may be more complicated than it needs to be. If the home is adding stress or frustration, it might be time to re-evaluate because your home should make life easier, not more difficult.

**2\. What would a move cost you?** Today’s rates are higher, which makes it difficult for many to move out of their old homes and purchase new ones. But many homeowners have built substantial equity, and that could help you reduce how much you borrow, lower your monthly payment, or remove mortgage insurance.

The numbers matter, but so does what you gain in the process. Imagine having a home with a better layout, a quieter street, and a home office that has a door. Think about what the move could give you, not just what it might take away.

**Are you staying intentionally?** Staying in your current home is a valid choice, but it should be a decision you make with clarity, not just because change feels hard. Ask yourself what would make this home work for you for the next three to five years. Would a small remodel help? Could you repurpose an underused space? If the answer is still no, then it may be time to explore other options.

When making big decisions, it’s essential to take a step back and consider the broader perspective. Interest rates matter, but so do your lifestyle, your equity, and your long-term goals. Before you make any decisions, take the time to weigh your options. A move might be worth it, or a few changes at home could be all you need.
